    <h1>about me</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>I am Siyabonga Mkhosana, from Gugulethu in the Cape Flats. If it wasn't for the LifeChoices Coding Academy, I would laugh if anyone said I can be a Front-end Developer or anything that involved any computerized development because it was not my area of expertise. Even though we had to learn a lot of work in a short space of time, the work is doable but one needs to farmiliarize themself with HTML & CSS on a daily in order to somewhat master or get used to the codes.</p>
